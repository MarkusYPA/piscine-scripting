## Backup Manager

### Overview

Backup Manager is a Python-based backup system that schedules and performs automated backups from the command line. The system allows users to create, list, and delete backup schedules, control a background service, and generate compressed `.tar` backup files. It solves the problem of automating local directory backups with proper logging and error handling.

### Role-play

You have been hired as junior DevOps engineers at a small company. The team currently performs manual backups of important directories, which is error-prone and time-consuming. Your manager has asked you to build an automated backup system that runs in the background, follows a schedule, and logs every action. Your mission is to deliver two Python scripts that work together to manage and execute scheduled backups reliably.

### Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will learn to:

- **Implement** scheduled file operations using Python
- **Design** a command-line interface that manages a background service
- **Build** file compression and archiving using the `tarfile` library
- **Analyze** process management techniques using `subprocess` and `os` modules
- **Implement** structured logging and error handling with `try` and `except` blocks

### Instructions

You will create two scripts that manage and perform scheduled backups.

#### Part 1: backup_manager.py

The script `backup_manager.py` orchestrates the backup service and manages the file `backup_schedules.txt`. It accepts the following command-line arguments:

- `create [schedule]`: Add a new backup schedule to `backup_schedules.txt`.
  - The schedule format is `"path_to_save;HH:MM;backup_name"`.
  - Log examples:
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] New schedule added: test2;16:07;office_docs`
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: malformed schedule: test;`

- `list`: Print the scheduled backups from `backup_schedules.txt`, with an index before each entry.
  - Log examples:
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Show schedules list`
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find backup_schedules.txt`

- `delete [index]`: Delete the backup schedule at the given index (starting at 0) from `backup_schedules.txt`.
  - Log examples:
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Schedule at index 3 deleted`
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find schedule at index 3`
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find backup_schedules.txt`

- `start`: Run `backup_service.py` in the background.
  - Log examples:
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] backup_service started`
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: backup_service already running`

- `stop`: Kill the `backup_service.py` process.
  - Log examples:
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] backup_service stopped`
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't stop backup_service`

- `backups`: List the backup files in `./backups`.
  - Log examples:
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Show backups list`
    - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find backups directory`

All actions and errors from `backup_manager.py` are logged to `./logs/backup_manager.log`.

#### Part 2: backup_service.py

The script `backup_service.py` checks the schedules in `backup_schedules.txt` and performs backups at the scheduled times.

- The service runs in an infinite loop.
- During each iteration, the service checks the backup schedules.
- The service performs a backup when the current hour and minute match a scheduled time.
- Schedules whose time has already passed are removed from `backup_schedules.txt` after processing.
- Backups are saved as compressed `.tar` files in `./backups`.
- All actions and errors from `backup_service.py` are logged to `./logs/backup_service.log`.

> At the end of each loop iteration, make the service sleep for about 45 seconds to save processor cycles.

#### Part 3: Logging and Error Handling

- All scripts must use `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors.
- All actions and errors are logged to the appropriate file in the `./logs` directory.
- `backup_manager.py` logs to `./logs/backup_manager.log`.
- `backup_service.py` logs to `./logs/backup_service.log`.
- Each log entry must start with a timestamp in the format `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm]`.
- Unknown or invalid commands must produce an appropriate error log entry.

### Usage

Here is an example showing how the backup system works (assuming the script runs at 16:07):

```bash
echo "--> Create 3 new schedules"
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test;16:07;backup_test"
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test1;16:07;personal_data"
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test2;16:07;office_docs"
echo "--> Try to add a malformed schedule"
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test;"
echo "--> Instruction list"
python3 ./backup_manager.py list
python3 ./backup_manager.py start
python3 ./backup_manager.py stop
echo "--> Instruction backups"
python3 ./backup_manager.py backups
echo "--> Content of the directory"
ls
echo "--> cat on ./logs/backup_manager.log"
cat ./logs/backup_manager.log
echo "--> cat on ./logs/backup_service.log"
cat ./logs/backup_service.log
echo "--> Content of ./backups"
ls ./backups
```

The output should be similar to:

```console
--> Create 3 new schedules
--> Try to add a malformed schedule
--> Instruction list
0: test;16:07;backup_test
1: test1;16:07;personal_data
2: test2;16:07;office_docs
--> Instruction backups
personal_data.tar
office_docs.tar
backup_test.tar
--> Content of the directory
backup_manager.py  backups  backup_schedules.txt  backup_service.py  logs
--> cat on ./logs/backup_manager.log
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] New schedule added: test;16:07;backup_test
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] New schedule added: test1;16:07;personal_data
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] New schedule added: test2;16:07;office_docs
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] Error: malformed schedule: test;
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] Show schedules list
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] backup_service started
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] backup_service stopped
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] Show backups list
--> cat on ./logs/backup_service.log
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] Backup done for test in backups/backup_test.tar
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] Backup done for test1 in backups/personal_data.tar
[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] Backup done for test2 in backups/office_docs.tar
--> Content of ./backups
backup_test.tar  office_docs.tar  personal_data.tar
```

### Tips

- Use `subprocess.Popen` with the flag `start_new_session=True` to run the backup service in the background.
- Use `os.kill` to stop a process by finding its process ID.
- Use `ps -A -f` to inspect active processes and their arguments during debugging.
- The standard library `tarfile` is very useful for creating `.tar` archives programmatically.
- Keep your code modular by creating single-task functions for each command.
